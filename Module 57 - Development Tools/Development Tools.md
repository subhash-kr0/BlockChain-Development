# Development Tools and SR Tools

## Subxt
**Subxt** is a library for building Rust applications that interact with Substrate-based blockchain nodes. It allows developers to submit extrinsics, query storage, and subscribe to events using a lightweight and type-safe API.

### Features
- Lightweight and type-safe API.
- Supports querying storage and submitting extrinsics.
- Compatible with Substrate-based blockchains.

---

## Tx Wrapper
**Tx Wrapper** is a JavaScript/TypeScript library designed to encode and decode Substrate transactions offline. It is commonly used in front-end applications and tools that interact with Substrate-based chains.

### Features
- Encode and decode Substrate transactions.
- Supports offline usage.
- Built for front-end interaction with blockchain nodes.

## Sub Flood
**Sub Flood** is a tool for load testing Substrate-based blockchains. It is used to simulate a large number of transactions to measure the network's performance under stress.

### Features
- Load testing for Substrate blockchains.
- Measures network performance under stress.
- Generates test scenarios for benchmarking.

## Substrate Archive
**Substrate Archive** is a service that provides indexed historical blockchain data for Substrate-based chains. It allows developers to query historical chain states efficiently without accessing the live node directly.

### Features
- Indexed historical blockchain data.
- Efficient querying for historical states.
- Supports archival and analytics use cases.

---

## Sidecar
**Sidecar** is an HTTP service for querying blockchain data from a Substrate-based node. It simplifies the process of interacting with chain data by providing RESTful endpoints.

### Features
- RESTful API for blockchain data.
- Simplifies interaction with Substrate-based chains.
- Useful for lightweight client applications.

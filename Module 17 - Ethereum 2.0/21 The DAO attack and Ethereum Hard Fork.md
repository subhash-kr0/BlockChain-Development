The DAO attack was a hack of The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The DAO was a crowdfunding platform that allowed users to invest in projects. In June 2016, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the DAO's code and stole 3.6 million ETH, worth about $50 million at the time.

The attack caused a major crisis for the Ethereum community. Some people argued that the Ethereum blockchain should be rolled back to before the attack, while others argued that the attack should be allowed to stand as a lesson for the future.

In the end, the Ethereum community decided to hard fork the blockchain. A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backwards compatible. This means that nodes that do not upgrade to the new protocol will be unable to communicate with nodes that have upgraded.

The Ethereum hard fork created two separate blockchains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). ETH is the blockchain that rolled back the DAO attack, while ETC is the blockchain that allowed the attack to stand.

The DAO attack and Ethereum hard fork were major events in the history of blockchain technology. They highlighted the need for security and robustness in DAOs and blockchain protocols. The hard fork also showed that the Ethereum community is committed to making Ethereum a successful platform for decentralized applications.

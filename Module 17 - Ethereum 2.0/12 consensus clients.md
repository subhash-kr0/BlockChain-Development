Consensus clients are software that runs on a node in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network. They are responsible for validating blocks and ensuring the security of the network.

In Ethereum 2.0, there are two types of consensus clients:

Beacon nodes: Beacon nodes are responsible for maintaining the Beacon Chain, which is the main blockchain in Ethereum 2.0. They also participate in the election of validators and the distribution of rewards.
Shard nodes: Shard nodes are responsible for maintaining the shard chains, which are the individual blockchains that make up Ethereum 2.0. They also participate in the consensus process and ensure that the shard chains are synchronized.
There are a number of different consensus clients available for Ethereum 2.0, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular consensus clients include:

Lighthouse: Lighthouse is a full Ethereum client that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is developed by Prysmatic Labs and is one of the most popular Ethereum 2.0 clients.

The best consensus client for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. If you are new to Ethereum 2.0, then Lighthouse is a good option as it is simple and easy to use. If you are looking for a more secure and reliable client, then Prysm is a good choice. And if you are looking for a scalable and secure client, then Teku is a good option.

An attestation in Ethereum 2.0 is a vote by a validator on the state of the blockchain. Attestations are used to ensure the accuracy of the blockchain and to prevent fraud.

In Ethereum 2.0, validators are randomly selected to attest to the state of the blockchain. This means that they vote on whether or not they believe the current state of the blockchain is accurate. If a validator attests to an incorrect state, they risk losing their staked ETH.

Attestations are used to ensure the accuracy of the blockchain in two ways. First, they help to prevent double-spends. A double-spend is when someone tries to spend the same ETH twice. If a validator attests to a block that contains a double-spend, their attestation will be rejected by the network.

Second, attestations help to prevent fraud. Fraud can occur when someone tries to manipulate the blockchain to their advantage. For example, someone could try to create a fake block or to alter the contents of a block. If a validator attests to a fraudulent block, their attestation will be rejected by the network.

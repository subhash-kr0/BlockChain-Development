A data rollup is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum 2.0 that enables the execution of transactions and the storage of data off-chain. This can help to improve the scalability and performance of Ethereum by reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main chain.

There are two main types of data rollups: optimistic rollups and zk-rollups.

Optimistic rollups: Optimistic rollups assume that transactions are valid by default. If a fraud is detected, a challenge can be made and the fraud proof will be verified by the validators. If the fraud proof is valid, the invalid transactions will be rolled back.
ZK-rollups: ZK-rollups use zero-knowledge proofs to prove the validity of transactions without revealing any of the underlying data. This makes ZK-rollups more secure than optimistic rollups, but they are also more computationally expensive.
Data rollups are still under development, but they have the potential to significantly improve the scalability and performance of Ethereum 2.0.

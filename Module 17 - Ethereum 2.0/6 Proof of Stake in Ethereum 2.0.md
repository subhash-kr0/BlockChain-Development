Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism that requires validators to stake their ETH in order to participate in the consensus process. Validators are randomly selected to add new blocks to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with ETH for doing so. This process is more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work, and it does not require miners to compete for block rewards.

 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is the consensus mechanism that will be used by the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. PoS is a more energy-efficient and secure consensus mechanism than Proof-of-Work (PoW), which is the current consensus mechanism used by Ethereum 1.0.

In PoS, validators are randomly selected to add new blocks to the blockchain based on the amount of ETH they have staked. This means that validators do not need to compete to solve complex mathematical problems, which makes PoS more energy-efficient than PoW.

PoS is also more secure than PoW because validators are incentivized to behave honestly. If a validator behaves dishonestly, they risk losing their staked ETH.

The transition from PoW to PoS is a major milestone for the Ethereum network. It is a step towards a more scalable, secure, and energy-efficient blockchain.

Gas costs in Ethereum 1.0 refer to the amount of Ether that is required to execute a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. The gas cost is determined by the complexity of the transaction and the current gas price.

The gas price is set by the market and can fluctuate depending on the demand for block space. The more congested the network is, the higher the gas price will be.

The gas cost is a way to prevent spam and ensure that the Ethereum network is not overloaded. It also helps to ensure that miners are compensated for their work.

The gas cost can be a barrier to entry for some users, especially those who are new to Ethereum. However, there are a number of ways to reduce gas costs, such as using a more efficient transaction method or optimizing the code of the smart contract.

The Beacon Chain is a layer 1 blockchain that is the foundation of Ethereum 2.0. It is responsible for coordinating the validators and ensuring the security of the network.

The Beacon Chain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, which means that validators are chosen randomly to add blocks to the chain based on the amount of ETH they stake. This makes the Beacon Chain more energy-efficient and secure than the Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain that is currently used by Ethereum.

The Beacon Chain is still under development, but it is expected to be fully launched in 2023. Once it is launched, it will be merged with the Ethereum mainnet, which will make Ethereum a fully PoS blockchain.

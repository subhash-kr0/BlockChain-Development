# Development Integration

Development integration in the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystems focuses on connecting applications and tools for seamless blockchain interaction and development. Key integration tools include Polkadot-JS, client libraries, and Substrate Connect.

## Polkadot-JS

Polkadot-JS is a suite of tools designed for interacting with Substrate-based blockchains. It provides:

1. **Polkadot-JS Apps:**
   - A web-based interface for managing accounts, exploring chain state, and submitting extrinsics.
   - Accessible via [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).

2. **Polkadot-JS API:**
   - A JavaScript library for interacting with Substrate-based chains.
   - Features include:
     - Submitting transactions.
     - Querying on-chain data.
     - Listening to chain events.
   - Installation:
     ```bash
     npm install @polkadot/api
     ```
   - Example Usage:
     ```javascript
     const { ApiPromise, WsProvider } = require('@polkadot/api');

     const main = async () => {
       const provider = new WsProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io');
       const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider });

       const chain = await api.rpc.system.chain();
       console.log(`Connected to ${chain}`);
     };

     main().catch(console.error);
     ```

## Client Libraries

Client libraries provide developers with tools to interact with Substrate-based blockchains in various programming languages:

1. **JavaScript/TypeScript:**
   - **Polkadot-JS API:** Comprehensive support for Substrate chains.

2. **Rust:**
   - **Subxt:** A lightweight client library for interacting with Substrate-based nodes.
   - Installation:
     ```bash
     cargo add subxt
     ```
   - Example:
     ```rust
     use subxt::ClientBuilder;

     #[subxt::subxt(runtime_metadata_path = "path/to/metadata.scale")]
     pub mod runtime {}

     #[tokio::main]
     async fn main() -> Result<(), subxt::Error> {
         let api = ClientBuilder::new().set_url("wss://rpc.polkadot.io").build().await?;
         let chain = api.rpc().system_chain().await?;
         println!("Connected to {}", chain);
         Ok(())
     }
     ```

3. **Python:**
   - **Polkascan API:** Limited support for querying chain data.

4. **Go:**
   - **GSRPC:** A Go client library for Substrate-based chains.

## Substrate Connect

Substrate Connect is a browser-based tool that enables decentralized applications (dApps) to interact with Substrate-based blockchains without relying on external RPC nodes. Key features include:

1. **Embedded Light Client:**
   - Runs directly in the browser, providing trustless access to blockchain data.
   - Eliminates reliance on third-party RPC providers.

2. **Easy Integration:**
   - JavaScript library for embedding Substrate Connect in dApps.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     import { ScProvider } from '@substrate/connect';
     import { ApiPromise } from '@polkadot/api';

     const main = async () => {
       const provider = new ScProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io');
       await provider.connect();

       const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider });
       const chain = await api.rpc.system.chain();
       console.log(`Connected to ${chain}`);
     };

     main().catch(console.error);
     ```

3. **Decentralized Access:**
   - Provides secure and decentralized access to blockchain data without the need for centralized nodes.

By leveraging these integration tools, developers can build robust and efficient applications for the Polkadot and Substrate ecosystems.

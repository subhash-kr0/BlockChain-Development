The SPDX License Identifier (SPDX ID) is a standard identifier for software licenses. It is used to uniquely identify a license and to make it easier to reference and manage licenses.

The SPDX ID is a 16-character string that is made up of the following parts:

A prefix, which identifies the type of license.
A unique identifier, which is assigned by the SPDX License List.
A suffix, which is optional and can be used to provide additional information about the license.
Some examples of SPDX IDs include:

MIT: The MIT License
Apache-2.0: The Apache License, Version 2.0
GPL-3.0-only: The GNU General Public License, Version 3.0 only
CC-BY-4.0: The Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License
The SPDX License Identifier is a valuable tool for software developers and other stakeholders. It can be used to:

Identify the licenses that apply to software.
Manage licenses and ensure that they are compliant with the law.
Communicate about licenses with other stakeholders.
Automate license compliance checks.
The SPDX License Identifier is a free and open standard. It is maintained by the SPDX Project, which is a community of software developers, lawyers, and other stakeholders

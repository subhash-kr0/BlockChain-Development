Comments in Solidity are used to explain the code and make it easier to understand. They can be used to provide documentation, explain the purpose of the code, or to debug the code.

There are two types of comments in Solidity: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//) and continue to the end of the line.

// This is a single-line comment
Multi-line comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk (/) and end with an asterisk and a forward slash (/).

/*
This is a multi-line comment
that can span multiple lines
*/
Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the code.

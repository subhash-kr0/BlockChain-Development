## Other alternative smart contract languages ##

1. Rust => Best but new and no more Libraries
2. Vyper => cool features , its more secure
3. Go => siliar to rust
4. Yul => just like to vyper

5. Solidity => contact oriented highly scalble programing language, static typed
    -> keywords
    -> Identifiers
    -> Literals
    -> Punctuation

    => Solidity Features
    * Syntax
    * File extension .sol
    * Application
    * Contracts
    * Data types
    * Contract deployment
    * Solidity compiler
    * Easy to learn
    * Smart Contracts
    * DEXes

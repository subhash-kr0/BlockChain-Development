# Client-Server Architecture
The client-server architecture is a foundational model for web development. It involves:
- **Client**: The user-facing part, usually a web browser or mobile app, which sends requests.
- **Server**: The backend infrastructure that processes requests, retrieves data, and sends responses.

### Workflow:
1. The client sends a request (e.g., accessing a webpage).
2. The server processes the request and fetches the required data.
3. The server sends a response back to the client.

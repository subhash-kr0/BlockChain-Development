# What are APIs?
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable communication between different software systems.
- They define a set of rules and protocols for accessing services or data.
- Example: Using a weather API to display real-time weather on a website.

### Types of APIs:
- **REST APIs**: Use HTTP requests and JSON responses.
- **GraphQL APIs**: Allow clients to request specific data structures.

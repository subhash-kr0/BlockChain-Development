# GraphQL API

## Queries
GraphQL API allows users to fetch specific data using queries. Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL retrieves only the requested data, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching.

### Example:
```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

---

## Sorting
Sorting allows the data to be returned in a specific order.

### Example:
```graphql
query {
  posts(orderBy: createdAt, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    title
    createdAt
  }
}
```

---

## Pagination
Pagination divides the data into manageable chunks.

### Example:
```graphql
query {
  posts(first: 10, skip: 10) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

---

## Filtering
Filtering enables querying data based on specific conditions.

### Example:
```graphql
query {
  posts(where: { author: "0x123...", published: true }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

---

## Time-travel Queries
Time-travel queries allow fetching data from a specific block number or timestamp.

### Example:
```graphql
query {
  post(id: "1", block: { number: 123456 }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

---

## Fulltext Search Queries
Fulltext search enables querying based on keywords or phrases.

### Example:
```graphql
query {
  articles(where: { content_contains: "blockchain" }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

---

## Validation
GraphQL provides built-in validation to ensure that the queries conform to the schema.

---

## Schema
The schema defines the structure of data and queries available in the API. It is written in SDL (Schema Definition Language).

### Example:
```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

---

## Entities
Entities are the data structures indexed by subgraphs. Each entity corresponds to a data type in the schema.

---

## Signalling
Signalling is done by curators to indicate the importance of subgraphs. Curators stake GRT tokens on subgraphs to show their quality and relevance.

---

## Curation
Curation ensures high-quality subgraphs are highlighted. Curators earn rewards based on the query fees generated by the subgraphs they signal.

---

## Delegators
Delegators delegate GRT tokens to indexers to earn a portion of the rewards without running their own node.

---

## Consumers
Consumers are applications that query data from The Graph network. They pay query fees in GRT tokens.

---

## Deploying Subgraphs
Subgraphs are deployed using the `graph-cli` tool. After deployment, they can be queried through the GraphQL API.

### Example Deployment:
```bash
graph deploy --product hosted-service <SUBGRAPH_NAME>
```

---

## Subgraph Logging
Subgraph logging helps in debugging and monitoring the indexing process.

### Example:
Use the following environment variable to enable detailed logs:
```bash
DEBUG=* graph indexer
```

---

## Graph Protocol Testnet Using Docker Compose
A testnet environment for The Graph can be set up using Docker Compose.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node
   ```
2. Start the Docker Compose environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Ethereum Node Monitoring Using The Graph, Prometheus, and Grafana
Monitoring Ethereum nodes is essential for performance and uptime.

### Tools:
- **The Graph**: Provides indexing and query capabilities.
- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics in dashboards.

### Steps:
1. Set up Prometheus and Grafana.
2. Integrate metrics from Ethereum nodes using exporters.
3. Visualize metrics in Grafana dashboards for analysis.

With these capabilities, The Graph and its GraphQL API empower developers to efficiently index, query, and utilize blockchain data.

Decentralized applications (dApps) are software programs that run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of on a single computer. This means that they are not controlled by any single entity and are accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

dApps have the potential to revolutionize many industries, including finance, healthcare, supply chain management, and voting. They can also be used to create new forms of entertainment and social media.

The dApps revolution is still in its early stages, but it is gaining momentum. There are now thousands of dApps in existence, and the number is growing rapidly.

The modern state of blockchain systems is rapidly evolving. New blockchain platforms are being developed all the time, and existing platforms are constantly being upgraded. This is leading to a more decentralized and secure ecosystem for dApps.

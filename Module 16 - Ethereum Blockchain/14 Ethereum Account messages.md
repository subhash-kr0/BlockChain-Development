An Ethereum message is a type of transaction that is used to call a function on a smart contract. Messages are similar to transactions in that they are signed by the sender's private key and they are executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). However, messages do not transfer Ether.

Messages have the following fields:

Sender: This is the address of the account that is sending the message.
Recipient: This is the address of the smart contract that is being called.
Function: This is the name of the function that is being called.
Arguments: These are the arguments that are being passed to the function.
GasLimit: This is the maximum amount of gas that the message is allowed to consume.
GasPrice: This is the price per unit of gas that the sender is willing to pay.

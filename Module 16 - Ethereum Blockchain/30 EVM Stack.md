The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stack is a data structure that is used to store data during the execution of smart contracts. The EVM stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure, which means that the data that is pushed onto the stack is the first data that is popped off the stack.

The EVM stack is used to store a variety of data, including:

The arguments of a function call: The arguments of a function call are pushed onto the stack before the function is called.
The return values of a function call: The return values of a function call are popped off the stack after the function has been called.
Temporary data: Temporary data that is used during the execution of a smart contract is also stored on the stack.

The Ethereum architecture is a layered architecture that consists of the following layers:

Consensus layer: The consensus layer is responsible for reaching agreement on the state of the blockchain. The current consensus mechanism for Ethereum is Proof-of-Work (PoW).
Execution layer: The execution layer is responsible for executing transactions and smart contracts. The current execution environment for Ethereum is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
State layer: The state layer stores the current state of the blockchain. The state layer is updated by the execution layer.
Data layer: The data layer stores the historical data of the blockchain. The data layer is used to verify the authenticity of transactions and smart contracts.
Application layer: The application layer is where decentralized applications (dApps) are built and deployed. The application layer uses the other layers to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

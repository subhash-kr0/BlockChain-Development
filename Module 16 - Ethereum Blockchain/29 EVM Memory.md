The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) memory is a data structure that is used to store data for smart contracts during the execution of their bytecode. The EVM memory is a stack-based data structure, which means that data is pushed and popped from the stack as it is needed.

The EVM memory is divided into two parts:

Local memory: The local memory is specific to each smart contract.
Memory pool: The memory pool is shared by all smart contracts.
The local memory is used to store data that is local to the smart contract, such as the contract's arguments, its local variables, and its return values. The memory pool is used to store data that is shared by multiple smart contracts, such as global variables and temporary data.

The EVM memory is a limited resource, and the amount of memory that is available to each smart contract is determined by the gas price. The gas price is the amount of Ether that is paid for each unit of gas, and it is used to pay for the execution of the smart contract's bytecode.

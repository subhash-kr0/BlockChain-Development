The total gas cost for an Ethereum transaction is calculated by multiplying the gas price by the gas used. The gas price is set by the sender of the transaction, and the gas used is determined by the complexity of the transaction.

The gas price is measured in gwei, which is a denomination of Ether. 1 gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH. The gas used is measured in units of gas.

The following formula can be used to calculate the total gas cost for an Ethereum transaction:

Total gas cost = gas price * gas used

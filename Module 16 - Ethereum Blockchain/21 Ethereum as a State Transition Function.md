Ethereum can be viewed as a state transition function. This means that the current state of the Ethereum blockchain is determined by the previous state and the transactions that have been executed.

The state of the Ethereum blockchain is a snapshot of all of the accounts, balances, and smart contracts on the blockchain. The transactions that have been executed are the instructions that have been used to update the state of the blockchain.

The state transition function is a mathematical function that takes the previous state and the transactions as input and outputs the new state. The state transition function is deterministic, meaning that it will always produce the same output for the same input.

The state transition function is implemented by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is a software program that runs on every Ethereum node. The EVM is responsible for executing transactions and updating the state of the blockchain.

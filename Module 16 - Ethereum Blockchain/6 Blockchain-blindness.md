Blockchain blindness is a property of some blockchains that prevents the blockchain data from being used in the scripting language. This means that the scripting language cannot access information such as the nonce and previous hash of the block, which can limit the applications of the blockchain.

In Bitcoin, for example, the scripting language is value-blind, which means that it cannot distinguish between different amounts of bitcoins. This makes it difficult to create smart contracts that require the transfer of specific amounts of bitcoins.

Blockchain blindness can be a problem for some applications, but it can also be a security feature. For example, it can prevent attackers from using the blockchain data to create fraudulent transactions.

There are a few ways to address blockchain blindness. One way is to use a different scripting language that is not value-blind. Another way is to use a sidechain, which is a separate blockchain that is connected to the main blockchain. Sidechains can be used to store data that is not needed on the main blockchain, such as the amounts of bitcoins being transferred.

Here are some of the limitations of blockchain blindness:

It can make it difficult to create smart contracts that require the transfer of specific amounts of money.
It can limit the applications of blockchain technology in gambling and other industries that require randomness.
It can make it more difficult to audit blockchain transactions.


However, blockchain blindness also has some benefits:

It can be a security feature, as it can prevent attackers from using the blockchain data to create fraudulent transactions.
It can make blockchain transactions more efficient, as the scripting language does not need to process as much data.
It can make blockchain transactions more private, as the scripting language cannot access information such as the sender and recipient of the transaction.

Lack of State Channels: In some blockchain discussions, the term "lack of state" could refer to the concept of state channels. State channels are a scaling solution used to conduct off-chain transactions that don't require every single transaction to be recorded on the blockchain. They work by creating an off-chain "state" where participants can perform transactions, and only the final state is settled on the blockchain. This approach helps reduce congestion on the main blockchain and improves scalability.

State in Blockchain: On the other hand, in the context of blockchain technology itself, "state" refers to the current condition or data of the blockchain network at any given moment. The state of a blockchain includes information about account balances, smart contract data, transaction history, and other relevant information. This state is updated through the execution of transactions and smart contracts.

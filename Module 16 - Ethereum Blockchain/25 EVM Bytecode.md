EVM bytecode is the machine code that is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is a low-level language that is used to implement smart contracts and other applications on the Ethereum blockchain.

EVM bytecode is a stack-based language, which means that it stores data on a stack. The stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. EVM bytecode instructions are executed by popping values off the stack and pushing values onto the stack.

EVM bytecode is a Turing-complete language, which means that it can be used to implement any computation that can be expressed in a Turing machine. This makes EVM bytecode a powerful tool that can be used to create a variety of decentralized applications.

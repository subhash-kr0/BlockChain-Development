An externally owned account (EOA) is a type of Ethereum account that is controlled by a private key. EOAs are the most common type of account on the Ethereum blockchain.

EOAs have four fields:

Nonce: This is a counter that is used to prevent replay attacks.
Balance: This is the amount of Ether that the account holds.
CodeHash: This is the hash of the code of the smart contract, if it is a contract account.
StorageRoot: This is the root of the Merkle tree that stores the account's storage data.
EOAs are created using a cryptographic key pair:

The private key: This is used to sign transactions and control the account.
The public key: This is derived from the private key and can be used to verify signatures.

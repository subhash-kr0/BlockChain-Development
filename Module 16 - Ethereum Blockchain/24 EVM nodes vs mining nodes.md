EVM nodes and mining nodes are both important parts of the Ethereum blockchain, but they have different roles.

EVM nodes are responsible for executing transactions and smart contracts. They do this by running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a software program that interprets and executes the bytecode of smart contracts.
Mining nodes are responsible for adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain. They do this by solving a cryptographic puzzle, which requires a lot of computing power. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a block reward, which is currently 2 ETH.
In most scenarios, all nodes on the Ethereum network are both EVM nodes and mining nodes. However, there are some nodes that only run the EVM and do not participate in mining. These nodes are called full nodes.

Here is a table summarizing the differences between EVM nodes and mining nodes:

Feature	                     EVM Node	                                Mining Node
Role	                     Executes transactions and smart contracts	Adds new blocks to the blockchain
Software	                 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)	            Ethereum mining software
Computing power required	 Low	                                    High
Reward	                     None	                                    Block reward

Sure, I can help you with that.

An opcode in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a single instruction that can be executed by the EVM. There are a total of 141 opcodes in the EVM, and they are divided into two main categories:

Stack instructions: These instructions operate on the stack, which is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure.
Memory instructions: These instructions operate on the memory, which is a storage area for data.
The EVM opcodes are represented by a single byte, and they are assigned a numeric value from 0 to 140. The numeric value of an opcode can be used to identify the opcode and to determine the number of bytes that are required to encode the opcode.

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for gas, which is the fee required to execute transactions and deploy smart contracts.

Ether can be divided into smaller units called wei. 1 ETH is equal to 10^18 wei. Other denominations of ether include:

Kwei (kETH): 1 kETH = 10^3 wei
Mwei (mETH): 1 mETH = 10^6 wei
Gwei (gETH): 1 gETH = 10^9 wei
Szabo (sETH): 1 sETH = 10^12 wei
Finney (fETH): 1 fETH = 10^15 wei
Babbage (bETH): 1 bETH = 10^18 wei
The smallest unit of ether is the wei. However, most people use gwei or szabo when talking about ether. This is because the denominations are more manageable and easier to use.

The symbol for ether is Îž (Xi).

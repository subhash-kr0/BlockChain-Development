The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) storage is a data structure that is used to store data for smart contracts. The EVM storage is divided into two parts:

Global storage: The global storage is shared by all smart contracts.
Local storage: The local storage is specific to each smart contract.
The EVM storage is a key-value store, where each key is a 32-byte hash and each value is a 256-byte value. The keys and values are stored in a linked list, and they are accessed using the keccak256 hash function.

The EVM storage is used to store a variety of data, including:

The state of smart contracts: The state of a smart contract is the data that is stored in the contract's storage. This data can include the contract's code, its variables, and its accounts.
The data of users: The data of users can be stored in the EVM storage, such as their addresses, their balances, and their tokens.
The data of applications: The data of applications can also be stored in the EVM storage, such as their state, their configuration, and their data.
The EVM storage is a secure and tamper-proof data store, and it is used to store a variety of data that is essential for the operation of the Ethereum blockchain.

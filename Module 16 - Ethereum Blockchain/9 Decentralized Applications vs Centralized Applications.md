The main difference between decentralized applications (dApps) and centralized applications is that dApps are not controlled by any single entity. They are run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers, which means that they are more secure and transparent than centralized applications.

Here is a table summarizing the key differences between dApps and centralized applications:

Feature	           Decentralized Applications	                      Centralized Applications
Control	           Not controlled by any single entity	              Controlled by a single entity, such as a company or government
Security	       More secure because they are not vulnerable to single points of failure	Less secure because they are vulnerable to attacks on the central server
Transparency      All transactions are recorded on the blockchain and are visible to everyone	Transactions are not visible to the public
Efficiency	      Can be more efficient because they do not require intermediaries	     Can be less efficient because they require intermediaries
Scalability	      Can be scaled to meet the needs of a growing user base	                Can be limited by the capacity of the central server
Complexity	      Can be more complex to develop and use	                                Can be easier to develop and use

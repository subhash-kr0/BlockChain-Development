# Asynchronous JavaScript

## What is Asynchronous JavaScript?
Asynchronous JavaScript allows the execution of tasks without blocking the main thread. It is essential for tasks like:
- Fetching data from APIs.
- Reading/writing files (in Node.js).
- Timers and animations.

This non-blocking nature ensures that JavaScript remains responsive, enabling a smooth user experience.

## Asynchronous Programming with Callbacks
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after a task is completed.

### Example:
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Data fetched');
        callback();
    }, 2000);
}

fetchData(() => {
    console.log('Callback executed');
});
```
### Limitations:
- **Callback Hell**: Nested callbacks can become difficult to read and maintain.

---

## Promises
Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task.

### States of a Promise:
1. **Pending**: Initial state.
2. **Fulfilled**: Operation completed successfully.
3. **Rejected**: Operation failed.

### Example:
```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true;

    if (success) {
        resolve('Task succeeded');
    } else {
        reject('Task failed');
    }
});

promise
    .then(result => console.log(result))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
### Advantages:
- Cleaner syntax compared to callbacks.
- Chainable with `.then()`.

---

## Async and Await
`async` and `await` provide a simpler way to work with Promises by writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous.

### Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        let json = await data.json();
        console.log(json);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
}

fetchData();
```
### Advantages:
- Easier to read and maintain.
- Handles errors using `try-catch`.

---

## Asynchronous Iteration
Asynchronous Iteration allows iterating over data sources that return Promises, such as streams or APIs.

### Example:
```javascript
async function processItems(items) {
    for await (let item of items) {
        console.log(item);
    }
}

const asyncIterable = {
    [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
        let i = 0;
        return {
            next() {
                if (i < 3) {
                    return Promise.resolve({ value: i++, done: false });
                }
                return Promise.resolve({ done: true });
            }
        };
    }
};

processItems(asyncIterable);
```
### Use Cases:
- Reading data from streams.
- Iterating over paginated API responses.

By leveraging these tools and patterns, JavaScript provides robust solutions for handling asynchronous tasks efficiently and cleanly.

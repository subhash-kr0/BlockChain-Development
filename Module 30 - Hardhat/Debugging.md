Solidity console.log
When running your contracts and tests on Hardhat Network you can print logging messages and contract variables calling console.log() from your Solidity code. To use it you have to import hardhat/console.sol in your contract code.

This is what it looks like:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Token {
  //...
}
Then you can just add some console.log calls to the transfer() function as if you were using it in JavaScript:

function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough tokens");

    console.log(
        "Transferring from %s to %s %s tokens",
        msg.sender,
        to,
        amount
    );

    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;

    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
The logging output will show when you run your tests:

$ npx hardhat test

As mentioned earlier, Truffle isn’t a single tool, but a suite of tools that come together to create a smooth development experience. These tools include Truffle CLI, Truffle Dashboard, Ganache, and Truffle for VS code.

Before we delve into each of these tools, their features, and how you can start using them, let's review the underlying libraries that power these tools.

A. Truffle Debugger (@truffle/debugger) is a portable Solidity debugger library that can be used with or without Truffle. It is a standalone package that is available on NPM, which means that anyone can install this library and use it as is, or build on it to offer an even better experience.

Truffle’s debugger is at the heart of every Truffle tool including Truffle CLI, and Truffle for VS Code with plans to integrate it into Truffle Dashboard. Some of its features are:

Solidity stepping and breakpoints
Variable inspection
Watch expressions
Rudimentary support for Vyper
and more!
B. Truffle Encoder & Decoder (@truffle/codec) library provides an interface for decoding Solidity smart contract state and information sent to, or from smart contracts using the Solidity ABI. It produces output in a machine-readable form that avoids losing any information. This is a low-level package for encoding, decoding, and data representation.

C. Truffle Fetch & Compile (@truffle/fetch-and-compile) is a library that is used to obtain externally verified sources and compile them.

Truffle allows developers to code, test, debug, and deploy smart contracts to Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchain networks. Here are some benefits that make Truffle a standout in the Ethereum ecosystem:

1. Insight into Transaction Details: Truffle Dashboard lets you inspect transactions before they occur by giving you more digestible information to more confidently approve or reject transactions.

2. Diagnose and fix errors quickly: The Truffle Debugger together with Truffle’s testing suite allows you to surgically diagnose errors when they occur and fix them quickly
3. Focus on your dapp’s uniqueness: Truffle offers a workflow that gets out of your way and lets you focus on your dapp’s unique functionality. It’s prescriptive enough to provide guidance, yet flexible enough to adapt to your needs.
4. Operate safely: With Ganache’s zero-config mainnet forking, you can easily test against live networks without spending real Ether. You can execute risky transactions in a sandbox and test integrations with production smart contracts, all with the same human-readable information and debugging tools you use for development networks.

5. Applicable at all stages of development: Regardless of whether your project began with Truffle CLI or another framework, Truffle can provide tooling and insights. We also support a number of different protocols and offer the ability to easily add support for new ones.

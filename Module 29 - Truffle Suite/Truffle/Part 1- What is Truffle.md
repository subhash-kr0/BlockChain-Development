Truffle is a collection of tools that simplifies the development of blockchain-based applications on EVM-compatible networks.
It includes tooling to help you, the developer, throughout your development cycle, from coding and testing to debugging and deployment.

Truffle focuses on the development of smart contracts, which are the foundation of EVM applications. It also includes tools for developing front-end applications that interact with smart contracts and a comprehensive suite of testing and debugging tools.

This allows developers to quickly and easily build and test their applications, reducing development time and increasing the reliability of the final product.

At its core, Truffle is made up of free and open-source software (FOSS) libraries. These libraries are built to be platform agnostic and interoperable, meaning they can be plugged into other tools fairly easily e.g. @truffle/fetch-and-compile, @truffle/codec, and @truffle/debugger.

Each library is assembled to form tools like Truffleâ€™s CLI (command-line interface), Truffle Dashboard, Truffle Debugger, Truffle for VS Code extension, and Ganache. Together, these make up the Truffle Suite of tools.

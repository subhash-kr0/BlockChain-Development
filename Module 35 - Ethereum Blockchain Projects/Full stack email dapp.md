# Full Stack Email DApp

A **Full Stack Email DApp** is an application that provides an end-to-end solution for managing email communication using blockchain technology. This type of DApp (Decentralized Application) ensures the security, transparency, and immutability of emails while eliminating the need for centralized email servers.

## Key Features:

1. **Decentralized Storage:**
   - Emails and metadata are stored on a blockchain.
   - No reliance on third-party servers.

2. **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):**
   - Emails are encrypted before being stored and decrypted upon retrieval.
   - Protects user privacy.

3. **Immutable Data:**
   - Emails and logs are tamper-proof.
   - Any changes are recorded on the blockchain.

4. **Tokenization:**
   - Users might be able to earn or spend tokens within the DApp.
   - Incentivizes good behavior and usage.

## Technologies Involved:

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js or Angular for the User Interface.
  
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.
  
- **Blockchain:**
  - Ethereum or other blockchain platforms.
  - Smart Contracts to handle logic, storage, and encryption.

- **Database:**
  - IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or Arweave for decentralized storage.
  
- **Cryptography:**
  - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for end-to-end encryption.
  
## Architecture:

1. **User Interface:**
   - The client-side handles user interaction.
   - React/Angular provides the necessary views and forms.
   
2. **Smart Contracts:**
   - Handle secure email storage, encryption, and retrieval.
   - Run on the blockchain.
   
3. **Backend:**
   - Communicates between the frontend and blockchain.
   - Manages API requests, and interacts with smart contracts.
   
4. **Storage:**
   - Emails and metadata are stored on decentralized storage platforms (e.g., IPFS).

## Workflow:

1. **User Registration:**
   - New users create an account.
   
2. **Email Encryption:**
   - Emails are encrypted using end-to-end encryption.
   
3. **Storage on Blockchain:**
   - Encrypted emails are sent to decentralized storage.
   
4. **Smart Contract Interactions:**
   - Smart contracts verify encryption and store metadata.
   
5. **Email Retrieval:**
   - When an email is retrieved, the system decrypts it.

## Security Considerations:

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) ensures privacy.**
- **Blockchain immutability protects against data manipulation.**
- **Access controls** are enforced through smart contracts and blockchain permissions.

## Benefits:

- Enhanced **privacy** and security.
- Reduced **dependence on centralized servers**.
- Increased **transparency** and **trust** for users.
- **Resistance to censorship** due to decentralized nature.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Fiat Money

Advantages
Gives central banks greater control over the economy
Is cost-efficient to produce
Provides governments with flexibility

Disadvantages
Is not a fool-proof way to protect the economy
Creates opportunity for a bubble
Provides risk of inflation

Advantages Explained

Fiat currencies gained prominence in the 20th century in part because governments and central banks sought to insulate their economies from the worst effects of the natural booms and busts of the business cycle.

Since fiat money is not a scarce or fixed resource like gold, central banks have much greater control over its supply, which gives them the power to manage economic variables such as credit supply, liquidity, interest rates, and money velocity. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve has the dual mandate to keep unemployment and inflation low, and using fiat money can help it meet those goals.

Fiat money serves as a good currency if it can handle the roles that a nation's economy requires of its monetary unit: Storing value, providing a numerical account, and facilitating exchange. It also has excellent seigniorage, meaning it is more cost-efficient to produce than a currency that is directly tied to a commodity.

Disadvantages Explained
The mortgage crisis of 2007 and subsequent financial meltdown tempered the belief that central banks could necessarily prevent depressions or serious recessions by regulating the money supply.

A currency tied to gold, for example, is generally more stable than fiat money because of the limited supply of gold.

There also are more opportunities for the creation of bubbles with fiat money due to its unlimited supply.

What is monetary policy and why is it important?

Central banks use monetary policy to manage economic fluctuations and achieve price stability, which means that inflation is low and stable. Central banks in many advanced economies set explicit inflation targets. Many developing countries also are moving to inflation targeting. 

Central banks conduct monetary policy by adjusting the supply of money, usually through buying or selling securities in the open market. Open market operations affect short-term interest rates, which in turn influence longer-term rates and economic activity. When central banks lower interest rates, monetary policy is easing. When they raise interest rates, monetary policy is tightening.

How has monetary policy been used recently?

After the global financial crisis that started in 2007, central banks in advanced economies eased monetary policy by reducing interest rates until short-term rates came close to zero, limiting options for additional cuts. Some central banks used unconventional monetary policies, buying long-term bonds to further lower long-term rates. Some even took short-term rates below zero. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks took actions to ease monetary policy, provide liquidity to markets, and maintain the flow of credit. To mitigate stress in currency and bond markets, many emerging market central banks used foreign exchange interventions, and for the first time, asset purchase programs. More recently, in response to rapidly growing inflation, central banks around the world have tightened monetary policy by increasing interest rates.


Monetary policy and exchange rates

A country’s monetary policy is closely linked to its exchange rate regime. A country’s interest rates affect the value of its currency, so those with a fixed exchange rate will have less scope for an independent monetary policy than ones with a flexible exchange rate. A fully flexible exchange rate regime supports an effective inflation-targeting framework.


Why do countries have macroprudential policies?

The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 showed that countries needed to identify and contain risks to the financial system as a whole. Many central banks adopted the use of prudential tools and established macroprudential policy frameworks to promote financial stability. Macroprudential tools are used to build buffers and contain vulnerabilities that make the financial system susceptible to shocks. This reduces the probability that shocks to the financial system disrupt the provision of financial services and cause serious negative consequences for the economy. Central banks are well placed to conduct macroprudential policy because they are able to analyze systemic risk and often are relatively independent and autonomous. Independence and autonomy are important because the institution responsible for macroprudential policy should be able to withstand political pressures and opposition from industry groups.

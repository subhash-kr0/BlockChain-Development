RIPEMD-160 (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest) is a cryptographic hash function with a 160-bit output. It was designed by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart Preneel in 1996. RIPEMD-160 is a member of the RIPEMD family of hash functions, which also includes RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256, and RIPEMD-320.

RIPEMD-160 is a collision-resistant hash function, which means that it is computationally infeasible to find two different messages that have the same RIPEMD-160 hash value. This makes RIPEMD-160 suitable for use in applications where it is important to be able to verify the authenticity of a message, such as digital signatures and file checksums.

RIPEMD-160 is also a fast hash function, which makes it suitable for use in applications where speed is important, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Here are some of the uses of RIPEMD-160:

Digital signatures
File checksums
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) competitions
Password hashing
Message authentication codes (MACs)
RIPEMD-160 has been superseded by more secure hash functions, such as SHA-256 and SHA-512. However, it is still widely used in many applications.

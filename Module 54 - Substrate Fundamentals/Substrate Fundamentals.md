# Substrate Fundamentals

Substrate is a blockchain development framework that simplifies the creation of customized blockchains. It provides developers with the tools and libraries necessary to build interoperable, scalable, and high-performance blockchain solutions.

## Runtime Environment and Setup

The runtime environment in Substrate is responsible for defining the business logic of the blockchain. Key components include:

1. **Wasm Runtime:** Substrate uses WebAssembly (Wasm) for runtime execution, ensuring portability and efficiency.
2. **Runtime Modules (Pallets):** Pre-built or custom modules that define blockchain functionality.
3. **Setup:**
   - Install Rust and Substrate prerequisites:
     ```bash
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     rustup update nightly
     rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
     ```
   - Clone the Substrate node template:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
     cd substrate-node-template
     cargo build --release
     ```

## Extrinsics

Extrinsics are actions that users or the system can execute on the blockchain. They are categorized as:

1. **Signed Extrinsics:** Require the sender's signature and are typically used for transactions.
2. **Unsigned Extrinsics:** Do not require a signature and are often used for system-level operations.
3. **Inherent Extrinsics:** Generated by the system and not included in user transactions (e.g., timestamp setting).

## Account Abstractions

Substrate provides a flexible account model that supports:

1. **Account Identifiers:** Derived from cryptographic keys.
2. **Multi-Signature Accounts:** Support for multiple signers on a single account.
3. **Account Types:** Different cryptographic schemes like ed25519 and sr25519.

Accounts are linked to balances and are essential for transaction validation.

## Transaction Pool

The transaction pool is a component of Substrate that:

1. **Validates Transactions:** Ensures transactions meet the required criteria before inclusion in a block.
2. **Prioritizes Transactions:** Based on fees and other metrics.
3. **Handles Gossip:** Shares valid transactions across network nodes.

---

## Session Keys

Session keys are cryptographic keys used by validators for secure communication in consensus mechanisms. Key points:

1. **Key Types:** Separate keys for different consensus protocols (e.g., GRANDPA, BABE).
2. **Key Rotation:** Regular updates for enhanced security.
3. **Management:** Session keys are managed using the Key Management System (KMS).

## Transaction Weight

Transaction weight is a mechanism to measure the computational and storage resources consumed by a transaction. Features include:

1. **Dynamic Weight:** Adjusts based on transaction complexity.
2. **Fee Calculation:** Higher weights result in higher transaction fees.
3. **Limits:** Prevents overloading the network by enforcing block weight limits.

## Execution

Substrate supports two types of execution environments:

1. **Native Execution:** Runs the runtime directly on the host machine for maximum performance.
2. **Wasm Execution:** Runs the runtime in a WebAssembly environment for portability and security.

The execution mode can switch dynamically based on the environment.

---

## Off-Chain Features

Substrate includes off-chain capabilities to enhance functionality:

1. **Off-Chain Workers:** Execute tasks that do not require consensus, such as data fetching or complex computations.
2. **Off-Chain Storage:** Temporary storage for data used by off-chain workers.
3. **Interoperability:** Off-chain workers can interact with external APIs and systems.

By understanding these Substrate fundamentals, developers can build powerful and customized blockchains tailored to specific use cases.

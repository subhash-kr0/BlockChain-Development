# Worker Threads and Messaging
Use Web Workers for background processing without blocking the UI:
- Create a worker:

```javascript
let worker = new Worker('worker.js');
worker.postMessage('Hello Worker');
worker.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log('Worker says:', event.data);
};
```

With these foundational concepts, JavaScript enables developers to create rich, interactive web applications that meet diverse user needs.

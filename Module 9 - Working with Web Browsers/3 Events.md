# Events
Events are the cornerstone of interactive web programming. JavaScript provides mechanisms to:
- Detect user actions like clicks, hovers, or key presses.
- Respond to browser lifecycle events like loading or unloading.
- Use **Event Listeners**:

```javascript
document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

UTXO - Unspend Transaction Output


UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output. It is a record of a Bitcoin transaction that has not yet been spent. UTXOs are used to track the ownership of Bitcoin and to facilitate transactions.

When a Bitcoin transaction is created, it spends one or more UTXOs and creates one or more new UTXOs. The new UTXOs are the outputs of the transaction, and they represent the coins that are being sent to the recipient of the transaction. The spent UTXOs are the inputs of the transaction, and they represent the coins that are being sent from the sender of the transaction.

The UTXO set is the collection of all unspent UTXOs in the Bitcoin blockchain. The UTXO set is constantly changing as new transactions are created and old transactions are spent.

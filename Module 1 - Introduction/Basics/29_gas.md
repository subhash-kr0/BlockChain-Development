// gas in Blockchain


Gas in blockchain is a unit of measurement used to quantify the computational resources required to execute a transaction or smart contract on a blockchain network. It is used to pay for the services of miners, who are responsible for validating and adding transactions to the blockchain ledger.

The amount of gas required for a transaction depends on the complexity of the transaction. For example, a simple transaction that transfers ETH from one account to another will require less gas than a transaction that creates a new smart contract.

The gas price is the amount of ETH that is paid per unit of gas. It is set by the sender of the transaction, and it can vary depending on the current demand for the network.

The total cost of a transaction is calculated by multiplying the gas price by the gas limit. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that the sender is willing to spend on the transaction.

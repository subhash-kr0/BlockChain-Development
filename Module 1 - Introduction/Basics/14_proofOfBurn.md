// Proof of Burn

Proof of burn (PoB) is a consensus mechanism in which validators demonstrate their commitment to the network by burning tokens. This means that they permanently remove them from circulation, which reduces the total supply of tokens.

PoB is an alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. PoW requires miners to compete to solve complex mathematical problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain. PoS, on the other hand, requires validators to stake tokens in order to be randomly selected to add blocks to the blockchain.

PoB is designed to be more energy-efficient than PoW, as it does not require miners to compete to solve complex mathematical problems. It is also more secure than PoS, as it is less vulnerable to attacks from whales (users with a large amount of tokens).

To participate in PoB, validators must burn tokens. This can be done by sending them to a burn address, which is a special address that cannot be used to receive tokens. Once tokens are burned, they are permanently removed from circulation.

The more tokens a validator burns, the more likely they are to be selected to add blocks to the blockchain. This is because validators with a larger stake have a greater incentive to keep the network secure.

PoB is a relatively new consensus mechanism, but it has the potential to be a more secure and energy-efficient alternative to PoW and PoS.

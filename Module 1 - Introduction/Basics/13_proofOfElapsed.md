// proof of Elapsed Time

Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) is a consensus mechanism that is used to determine who gets to add the next block to a blockchain network. It is an alternative to the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which is used by Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.

In PoET, each node in the network is assigned a random waiting time. The node that finishes waiting first is randomly selected to add the next block to the blockchain. This process is repeated for each new block.

PoET is designed to be more energy-efficient than PoW, as it does not require nodes to compete to solve complex mathematical problems. It is also more scalable, as it can be used by larger networks without sacrificing security.

However, PoET is not as decentralized as PoW, as it requires nodes to be trusted to follow the protocol. Additionally, it is still a relatively new consensus mechanism, so there is less research on its security and efficiency.

Here are some of the advantages of proof of elapsed time:

More energy-efficient than proof-of-work
More scalable
Less hardware-intensive
Less susceptible to centralization
Here are some of the disadvantages of proof of elapsed time:

Less decentralized than proof-of-work
Less secure
Still a relatively new consensus mechanism

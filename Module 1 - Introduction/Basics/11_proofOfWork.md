// proof of work
Proof of work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used by blockchain networks to validate new transactions and add them to the blockchain. It is a competition in which miners (participants in the network) compete to solve a computationally difficult puzzle. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a block of newly created cryptocurrency and is also allowed to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain.

PoW is a secure way to validate transactions because it is very difficult to cheat the system. In order to do so, a miner would need to have more computing power than the rest of the network combined. This is not feasible, as the network is constantly growing and becoming more powerful.

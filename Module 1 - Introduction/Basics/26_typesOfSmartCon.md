// Types of Smart Contracts


There are many different types of smart contracts, but some of the most common ones include:

Smart legal contracts: These contracts are designed to be legally enforceable. They can be used to automate the execution of contracts, reduce the need for third parties, and improve transparency.

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): DAOs are organizations that are run by smart contracts. They are not subject to the control of any central authority, and they can be used to manage a variety of assets and activities.

Application logic contracts: These contracts are used to automate the execution of specific tasks. They can be used for things like managing supply chains, processing payments, and controlling access to resources.

Digital identity: Smart contracts can be used to create and manage digital identities. This can be used to improve security, reduce fraud, and make it easier for people to interact with each other online.

High-security: These contracts are designed to be highly secure. They can be used to store sensitive data, such as financial information or medical records.

The terms altcoin and token are often used interchangeably, but there is a technical difference between the two.

Altcoin is a short form of "alternative coin" and refers to any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and all other cryptocurrencies are considered altcoins.
Token is a digital asset that is created on top of another blockchain. For example, Ethereum is a blockchain, and ERC-20 tokens are tokens that are created on the Ethereum blockchain.
So, all altcoins are tokens, but not all tokens are altcoins.

Here are some examples of altcoins:

Ethereum
Litecoin
Ripple
Dogecoin
Tether
Here are some examples of tokens:

ERC-20 tokens
ERC-721 tokens
BEP-20 tokens
SOLANA tokens

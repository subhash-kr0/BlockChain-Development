Ripple is a blockchain-based payment protocol that allows for the transfer of money between two parties without the need for a third party intermediary, such as a bank. Ripple is a distributed ledger system, which means that all transactions are recorded on a shared database that is maintained by all nodes in the network.

Ripple is not a cryptocurrency, but it uses a digital asset called XRP to facilitate payments. XRP can be used to pay transaction fees or to be held as a store of value.

Ripple is designed to be scalable and efficient, and it can be used to process a large number of transactions per second. It is also designed to be interoperable with other blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Ripple is used by a variety of financial institutions, including banks, payment processors, and remittance companies. It is also used by a number of businesses, such as Overstock and MoneyGram.

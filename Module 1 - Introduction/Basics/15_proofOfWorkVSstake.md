//    proof of work vs   proof of stake

 1. Need to do some work to mine a block 
 2. Consumes physical resources CPU power and time
 3. Process is power consuming
 4. To add each block miner complete with each other to solve a puzzel
 5. Initial investment is needed to busy hardware

 -> proof of stake
 1. Need sufficient stacke to mine a block
 2. No external resources are used
 3. Process is power efficient
 4. There is no such competition as the block creator is chosen by algorithm which is based on stacke
 5. initial investment is needed to buy stack and build reputation

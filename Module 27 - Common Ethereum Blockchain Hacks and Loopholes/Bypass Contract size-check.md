Yes, it is possible to bypass contract size check in Solidity. This can be done by using a technique called "code injection." Code injection is a way of injecting malicious code into a contract.

To understand how code injection works, let's look at an example. Suppose we have a contract called Foo that has a function called bar(). The bar() function takes a string as input.

The Foo contract might look like this:

contract Foo {
  function bar(string memory input) {
    // Do something with the input string.
  }
}
An attacker could inject malicious code into the input string. This malicious code could then be executed when the bar() function is called.

To inject malicious code into the input string, the attacker could use a technique called "cross-site scripting (XSS)." XSS is a vulnerability in web applications that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a web page.

Once the malicious code is injected into the input string, it can be executed when the bar() function is called. This could allow the attacker to take control of the contract or steal funds.

Code injection is a serious vulnerability that can affect smart contracts. However, there are ways to prevent it. By using a technique called "input validation," developers can help to protect their contracts from code injection attacks.

Input validation is a way of checking the input data to make sure that it is valid. This can help to prevent malicious code from being injected into a contract.

Here are some additional tips to help you avoid code injection attacks:

Use input validation to check the input data.
Be aware of the risks of code injection and take steps to protect yourself.
By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from code injection attacks.

In addition to code injection, there are other ways to bypass contract size check. One way is to use a technique called "static analysis." Static analysis is a way of analyzing code without executing it. This can be used to find potential vulnerabilities in code, such as contract size check bypass.

Another way to bypass contract size check is to use a technique called "dynamic analysis." Dynamic analysis is a way of analyzing code by executing it. This can be used to find vulnerabilities in code that are not visible through static analysis.

Both static analysis and dynamic analysis can be used to help protect smart contracts from vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that no technique is foolproof. There will always be new vulnerabilities that are discovered.

It is important to be aware of the risks of smart contract vulnerabilities and take steps to protect yourself. By using a combination of techniques, such as input validation, static analysis, and dynamic analysis, you can help to protect your smart contracts from attack.

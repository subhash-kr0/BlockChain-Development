Yes, it is possible to hide malicious code with an external contract in Solidity. This can be done by creating a contract that has a function that calls an external contract. The malicious code can be hidden in the external contract, and it will only be executed when the function is called.

To understand how this works, let's look at an example. Suppose we have a contract called Foo that has a function called bar(). The bar() function calls an external contract called Mal. The Mal contract contains the malicious code.

The Foo contract might look like this:

contract Foo {
  function bar() {
    // Call the Mal contract.
    Mal.call();
  }
}
The Mal contract might look like this:

contract Mal {
  // Malicious code goes here.
}
When the bar() function is called, the malicious code in the Mal contract will be executed.

This technique can be used to hide malicious code from being detected by security scanners. However, it is important to note that this technique is not foolproof. If the malicious code is discovered, it can still be exploited by attackers.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about hiding malicious code with an external contract:

The malicious code must be hidden in a way that is not easily detectable.
The external contract must be deployed to the blockchain before the malicious code can be executed.
The malicious code can only be executed when the function in the first contract is called.
If you are considering using this technique, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits carefully. It is also important to consult with a security expert to ensure that the technique is implemented correctly.

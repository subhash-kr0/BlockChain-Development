A re-entrancy attack is a type of attack on a smart contract that occurs when a function in the contract is called recursively, or called multiple times, from within itself. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the state of the contract and steal funds.

To understand how a re-entrancy attack works, let's look at an example. Suppose we have a smart contract that has a function called withdraw() that allows users to withdraw funds from the contract. The withdraw() function might look like this:

function withdraw(uint256 amount) {
  // Check if the user has enough funds to withdraw.
  if (balance < amount) {
    throw;
  }

  // Subtract the amount from the user's balance.
  balance -= amount;

  // Send the amount to the user.
  payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
Now, suppose an attacker calls the withdraw() function with a large amount of funds. The attacker can then call the withdraw() function again, before the first withdrawal has been completed. This will allow the attacker to withdraw the same funds twice.

To prevent re-entrancy attacks, it is important to use a technique called call-stack depth checking. Call-stack depth checking is a way of limiting the number of times a function can be called recursively. This can be done by using a variable to keep track of the call stack depth, and then checking this variable before calling the function recursively.

Another way to prevent re-entrancy attacks is to use a technique called gas metering. Gas metering is a way of limiting the amount of gas that a function can use. This can be done by using a variable to keep track of the gas used, and then checking this variable before calling the function.

By using call-stack depth checking or gas metering, you can help to prevent re-entrancy attacks and protect your smart contracts from being hacked.

Here are some additional tips to help you avoid re-entrancy attacks:

Be careful about calling functions that can be called recursively.
Use call-stack depth checking or gas metering to limit the number of times a function can be called recursively.
Use a secure coding style and avoid using functions that are known to be vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks.
Get your code audited by a security expert before deploying it to the blockchain.
By following these tips, you can help to protect your smart contracts from re-entrancy attacks.

A doctype is a document type declaration in HTML. It tells the web browser what version of HTML the document is written in. 
The doctype is always the first line in an HTML file.

The HTML boilerplate is a set of common HTML elements that are used to create a basic web page. It typically includes the doctype,
 the head section, the body section, and some basic markup for the title, meta tags, and links.

An HTML file is a text file that contains the code for a web page. The code is written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is a markup language that describes the structure of a web page.

An HTML file typically has the following parts:

The DOCTYPE declaration tells the web browser what version of HTML is being used.
The head section contains information about the web page, such as its title and the keywords that should be used to index it.
The body section contains the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and links.

# Custom Data Feeds Using Any API

Custom data feeds allow developers to integrate external APIs to fetch, process, and utilize data in their applications. Below are the steps and considerations for working with APIs effectively.

---

## Make a GET Request

A GET request is used to fetch data from an API endpoint. Here's how to make a basic GET request:

### Example (Python):
```python
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/data"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Data fetched successfully")
    print(response.json())
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch data: {response.status_code}")
```

### Key Points:
- Ensure the endpoint URL is correct.
- Check the API documentation for required headers and parameters.
- Handle HTTP status codes appropriately.

## Multi-Variable Responses

Some APIs return responses with multiple variables or nested structures. Parsing these responses requires careful handling.

### Example:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
  },
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Python Parsing:
```python
response_data = response.json()
user_id = response_data["user"]["id"]
user_name = response_data["user"]["name"]
status = response_data["status"]

print(f"User ID: {user_id}, Name: {user_name}, Status: {status}")
```

### Tips:
- Use libraries like `json` for structured parsing.
- Validate the response schema to avoid key errors.

---

## Large Responses

Handling large responses efficiently can prevent memory issues and improve performance.

### Strategies:
- **Pagination**: Fetch data in smaller chunks using query parameters like `page` and `limit`.
- **Streaming**: Use libraries that support streaming responses to avoid loading the entire payload at once.

### Example (Pagination):
```python
params = {"page": 1, "limit": 50}
response = requests.get(url, params=params)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
```

## Make an Existing Job Request

APIs that involve job processing often allow you to trigger predefined jobs or workflows.

### Example Request:
```python
job_url = "https://api.example.com/jobs/start"
payload = {"job_type": "data_processing", "parameters": {"input": "file.csv"}}
response = requests.post(job_url, json=payload)

if response.status_code == 202:
    print("Job started successfully")
    print(response.json())
else:
    print("Failed to start job")
```

---

## Find Existing Jobs

Finding existing jobs involves querying the API for job statuses or details.

### Example:
```python
query_url = "https://api.example.com/jobs"
params = {"status": "pending"}
response = requests.get(query_url, params=params)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Jobs fetched successfully")
    print(response.json())
else:
    print("Failed to fetch jobs")
```

---

## Contract Addresses

For APIs dealing with blockchain, contract addresses are critical for identifying smart contracts.

### Example:
```python
contract_address = "0x123456789abcdef"
api_url = f"https://api.blockchain.com/contracts/{contract_address}"
response = requests.get(api_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Contract details:")
    print(response.json())
else:
    print("Failed to fetch contract details")
```

### Tips:
- Validate contract addresses before making requests.
- Use API-specific methods to fetch contract details or execute transactions.

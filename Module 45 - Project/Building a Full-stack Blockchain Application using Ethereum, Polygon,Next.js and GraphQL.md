# Building a Full-stack Blockchain Application

This guide covers the process of building a full-stack blockchain application using Ethereum, Polygon, Next.js, and GraphQL.

---

## Technologies Used
1. **Ethereum**: The primary blockchain network for decentralized applications (dApps).
2. **Polygon**: A layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions.
3. **Next.js**: A React-based framework for building modern web applications with server-side rendering.
4. **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, enabling efficient and flexible data retrieval.

---

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of blockchain and smart contracts.
- Familiarity with React and Next.js.
- Understanding of GraphQL and its usage.
- Installed tools: Node.js, npm/yarn, and a code editor (e.g., VS Code).

## Steps to Build the Application

### 1. Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Install Node.js and npm/yarn**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   yarn -v
   ```

2. **Initialize a Next.js Project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest fullstack-blockchain-app
   cd fullstack-blockchain-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn add ethers graphql apollo-client @apollo/client
   ```

4. **Setup Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file to store sensitive data like private keys and API URLs.

### 2. Writing and Deploying Smart Contracts
1. **Set Up Hardhat**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat
   ```
   - Choose "Create a sample project".

2. **Write a Smart Contract**:
   Create a new contract (e.g., `contracts/MyContract.sol`). Example:
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract MyContract {
       string public message;

       function setMessage(string memory _message) public {
           message = _message;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract**:
   Configure the `hardhat.config.js` file for Ethereum/Polygon.
   Deploy using a script in the `scripts` folder:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon
   ```

---

### 3. Integrating GraphQL
1. **Setup The Graph**:
   - Install the Graph CLI:
     ```bash
     yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
     ```
   - Initialize a subgraph:
     ```bash
     graph init --studio my-subgraph
     ```

2. **Define a Subgraph**:
   Edit the `subgraph.yaml` to include the contract and event details.

3. **Deploy the Subgraph**:
   ```bash
   graph deploy --studio my-subgraph
   ```

---

### 4. Frontend Integration with Next.js
1. **Connect to Ethereum/Polygon**:
   Use `ethers.js` to connect:
   ```javascript
   import { ethers } from "ethers";

   const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("<RPC_URL>");
   ```

2. **Query with GraphQL**:
   Use Apollo Client:
   ```javascript
   import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from "@apollo/client";

   const client = new ApolloClient({
       uri: "<GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>",
       cache: new InMemoryCache(),
   });

   const GET_DATA = gql`
       query {
           entities {
               id
               field
           }
       }
   `;

   const data = await client.query({ query: GET_DATA });
   ```

3. **Build UI Components**:
   Use Next.js pages and components to display blockchain data and interact with the smart contract.

---

### 5. Deployment
1. **Deploy the Frontend**:
   Use Vercel for deploying the Next.js application:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

2. **Monitor the Application**:
   Use tools like The Graph Explorer and PolygonScan to monitor contract activity and subgraph queries.

---

## Summary
By combining Ethereum, Polygon, Next.js, and GraphQL, you can build a scalable and efficient full-stack blockchain application. The setup provides an ideal structure for leveraging blockchain data while delivering a modern user experience.
